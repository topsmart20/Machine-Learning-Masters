# College_Admit_Predictor
This repository consists of College_Admit_Predictor web app which I created using ML.

This is a Machine Learning project I've created using Flask framework. The purpose of this web app is to calculate your chances of getting admitted into a college.

I have used previous years data to train my ML Model for predicting future predictions based on the pattern.
The algorithm used is Linear Regression, as the data was linear in nature it was the best option to go with. This can be used for both an API call and also as for direct website interacton.
