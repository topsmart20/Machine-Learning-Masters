Or alternatively, you can go to the heroku website and create an app directly. Before deploying the code to the Heroku cloud, we need to commit the changes to the git repository. Type the command git init to initialize a local git repository. Enter the command git status to see the uncommitted changes. Enter the command git add . to add the uncommitted changes to the local repository. Enter the command git commit -am \"make it better\" to commit the changes to the local repository. Enter the command git push heroku master to push the code to the heroku cloud. After deployment, heroku gives you the URL to hit the web API. Once your application is deployed successfully, enter the command heroku logs --tail to see the logs."
